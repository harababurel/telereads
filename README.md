## Deploy your own

You can deploy your own instance of this bot. You will need a few things:

* A Telegram bot token. Contact [@BotFather](http://telegram.me/BotFather) in order to create a new bot and receive a token.
* A Goodreads API key. Apply for one [here](https://www.goodreads.com/api).
* A working installation of [Rust](https://www.rustup.rs/).

Once you have both of these keys, you need to store them as environment variables:

```bash
$ export TELEGRAM_TOKEN="123456789:XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
$ export GOODREADS_TOKEN="XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
```

And then install and run TelereadsBot:

### From GitHub

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/harababurel/telereads.git
$ cd telereads
$ RUST_LOG=info cargo run --release
```

Aditionally, this repo includes a systemd service file ([telereads.service](https://github.com/harababurel/telereads/blob/master/telereads.service)) which can be used to deploy the bot. After setting the proper variables in the service file:

```bash
$ systemctl start telereads
```

### From crates.io

```bash
$ cargo install telereads
$ RUST_LOG=info telereads
```
